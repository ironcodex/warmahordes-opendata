description: >
  The weapon stat bars of warjacks and huge-based models indicate
  where their weapons are located: left arm (L), right arm (R), head (H),
  or superstructure (S). When all of a warjack's system boxes for a location
  have been damaged, that system is crippled. A weapon that is not in
  one of these locations is marked with " - ."

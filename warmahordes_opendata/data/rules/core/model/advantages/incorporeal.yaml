--- !warmahordes_opendata.Rule
name: Incorporeal
description: >
  This model treats all non-impassable terrain as open terrain
  while advancing. It can move through obstructions and through other models
  if it has enough movement to move completely past them. While charging,
  slam power attacking, or trample power attacking, this model does not
  stop its movement when it contacts an obstacle, an obstruction, or another
  model. Other models, including slammed, pushed, or thrown models, can
  move through this model without effect if they have enough movement to
  move completely past it. This model does not count as an intervening model.
  This model is immune to continuous effects and non-magical damage. This
  model cannot be moved by a push, slam, or throw. When this model makes
  a melee or ranged attack, before the attack roll is made it loses Incorporeal
  until the start of its next activation. This model cannot make free strikes
  while Incorporeal.

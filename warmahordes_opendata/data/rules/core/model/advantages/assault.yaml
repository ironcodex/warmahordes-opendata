description: >
  This model can make an Assault ranged attack.


  A model with the Assault advantage can make one ranged attack as part of a
  charge during its activation. This ranged attack must occur after the model
  ends its movement but before it begins its Combat Action and must target the
  model charged. A model that begins a charge in melee cannot make an Assault
  ranged attack as part of that charge. If the target is not in the charging
  model's melee range after ending its movement, the charge fails, but the
  model with Assault can still make the Assault ranged attack before its
  activation ends. A model can make an Assault ranged attack while in melee.

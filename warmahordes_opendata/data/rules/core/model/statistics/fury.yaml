  Like FOCUS, FURY is a measure of model's primal arcane power.
  For warbeasts, FURY indicates how much the beast can be forced. When warbeasts
  are forced to perform certain actions, they generate fury. Models with
  the Fury Manipulation ability, such as warlocks, draw on tha tfury to
  enhance their own abilities. FURY determines a model's control range and
  beginning fury points, and the model uses its FURY when making magic attack
  rolls.

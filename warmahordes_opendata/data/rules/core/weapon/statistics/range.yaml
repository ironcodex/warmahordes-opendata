name: Range
abbreviation: RNG
description: >
  The maximum distance in inches between the attack's point of
  origin and the target before the attack will automatically miss. Measure
  range from the edge of the point of origin's base nearest to the target,
  up to the maximum range of the attack. Spray attacks use special range
  descriptors beginning with "SP". A RNG of "CTRL" indicates the weapon
  can target any model in the attacking model's control range. Remember,
  the attacking model needs line of sight to a model to target it. A RNG
  of "*" indicates the model's special rules contain information about
  determining the RNG. Some special rules can affect a weapon's range. If
  a weapon's RNG is reduced to 0 or less by some effect, the weapon cannot
  be used to make attacks.

name: Advancing
description: >
  Advancing refers to movement a model intentionally makes, not
  to involuntary movement caused by other effects, such as being pushed
  or slammed. A model can change its facing at any time during its advance,
  but when it advances it must always move in the direction it is facing.
  Make all measurements from the front of an advancing model's base. Determine
  the distance a model advances by measuring how far the leading edge of
  its base travels. The distance moved is absolute. Changing facing by rotating
  in place is still advancing even though the model's position on the table
  does not change. A model's base cannot pass over another model's base
  while advancing. This means that if a gap between the bases of two models
  is too small for another model's base to fit between them, the third model
  cannot move through the space.

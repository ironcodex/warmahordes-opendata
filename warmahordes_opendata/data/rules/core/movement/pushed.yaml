name: Pushed
description: >
  Sometimes models can be pushed as a result of an attack, a
  special rule, or a spell. A pushed model moves at half rate through rough
  terrain, suffers the effects of any hazards through which it moves, and
  stops if it contacts an obstacle, an obstruction, or another model.

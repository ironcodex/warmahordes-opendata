name: Run
description: >
  The model advances up to twice its current speed (SPD) in
  inches. When a model uses its Normal Movement to run, it must forfeit
  its Combat Action before advancing and its activation ends as soon as
  it completes its run movement. A model cannot use its Normal Movement
  to run after casting a spell or using a feat that activation.


  If a model cannot run due to some effect and is required to use its Normal
  Movement to run, instead of running it forfeits its Combat Action and
  makes a full advance, then its activation ends. A model that is required
  to run for some reason cannot cast spells or use its feat even if it
  cannot run.


  Some models must meet special requirements to run:

  - A warjack must spend 1 focus point to use its Normal Movement to run.

  - A warbeast must be forced to use its Normal Movement to run.

  - A trooper must receive a Press Forward order to use its Normal Movement
  to run, or it must be compelled to run as a result of a game effect (such
  as being out of formation). A trooper that receives the Press Forward
  order must use its Normal Movement to either run or charge.

description: >
  Only colossals and gargantuans can make power strikes.


  A model making a power strike power attack uses the force of its tremendous
  melee power to send a smaller-based model flying. A model must have at
  least one non-crippled weapon with the Open Fist weapon quality to make
  a power strike power attack. The power strike power attack has a melee
  range equal to that weapon's melee range. Its target must be in the Open
  Fist's field of fire and have a smaller base than the colossal or
  gargantuan.


  The attacking model makes a melee attack against the target. If the attack
  hits, the target is slammed d6 + 2 directly away from the colossal or
  gargantuan and suffers a power attack damage roll.

  attacks. A heavy warjack with at least one non-crippled weapon with the Open
  Fist weapon quality can make throw power attacks. A heavy warbeast with at
  least one weapon with the Open Fist weapon quality can make throw power

  - A colossal or gargantuan can make head-butt, slam, and trample power

  Unless otherwise noted, a model can make a power attack only during its

  A model that is able to do so can make additional melee attacks after making
  a power attack. A model cannot make a power attack as an additional attack.

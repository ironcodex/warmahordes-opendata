name: Head-Butt
description: >
  A model making a head-butt power attack smashes its head into
  a model to drive it to the ground. A head-butt power attack made by a
  colossal or gargantuan has a 2" melee range. A head-butt power attack
  made by any other model has a 0.5 melee range. The attacking model makes
  a melee attack roll against its target. If the attack hits, the target
  becomes knocked down and then suffers a power attack damage roll.


  A model cannot head-butt a model with a larger base.

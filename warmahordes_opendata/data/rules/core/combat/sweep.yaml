name: Sweep
description: >
  A colossal or gargantuan can use its arms to scythe through
  models within its reach. A colossal or gargantuan chooses a non-crippled
  melee weapon with a location of L or R to make the sweep power attack.
  It then makes one melee attack with the weapon against each model in the
  weapon's field of fire that is within the weapon's melee range, ignoring
  intervening models when determining line of sight. This power attack does
  not require a target, but each separate attack does. These attacks are
  simultaneous. Models hit suffer a power attack damage roll.

name: Engaged & Engaging
description: >
  When a model is within an enemy model's melee range and in
  that model's line of sight, it is engaged. When a model has an enemy model
  in its melee range and line of sight, it is engaging that model. When
  a model is either engaged or engaging, it is in melee, which prevents
  it from making ranged attacks.

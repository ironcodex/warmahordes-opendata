--- !warmahordes_opendata.Rule
name: Flight
description: >
  This model treats all non-impassable terrain as open terrain
  while advancing. It can advance through obstructions and other models
  if it has enough movement to move completely past them. While charging,
  slam power attacking, or trample power attacking, this model does not
  stop its movement when it contacts an obstacle, an obstruction, or another
  model. This model ignores intervening models when declaring its charge
  target. While knocked down or stationary, this model loses Flight.

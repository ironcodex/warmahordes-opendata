  This model is a gunfighter.


  A model with the Gunfighter advantage can make ranged attacks targeting
  models in its melee range and/or can target models engaging it. A model
  with the Gunfighter advantage can also make free strikes with ranged weapons.
  If it does not have a melee weapon, it gains a melee range of 0.5".


  A model with the Gunfighter advantage can make charges. If it makes a
  charge, the model can make its initial attacks with its ranged weapons,
  but these attacks can target only models in its melee range. The charging
  gunfighter's first melee or ranged attack after ending its charge movement
  must target the model it charged. If the charging gunfighter did not fail
  its charge and cannot make its first melee or ranged attack against the
  charge target, the charging gunfighter can make its first attack against
  any eligible target. Remember, your first attack after charging is a charge
  attack only if you make it with a melee weapon, and a model in melee cannot
  aim.


  Gunfighter does not allow a model to make melee and ranged attacks during
  the same activation.

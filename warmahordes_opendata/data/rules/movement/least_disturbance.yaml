name: Least Disturbance
description: >
  Some rules can cause the bases of moving models to overlap
  those of other models temporarily, such as when a model is thrown or
  slammed. Once the model has stopped moving, models must be repositioned
  so that no bases overlap. The model that was moving stays in its final
  position; other models are moved out of the way to make room. If the
  model that was moving overlaps the base of a model that cannot be moved,
  the moving model is repositioned using the rule of least disturbance.


  To determine which models to move and where to move them, first identify
  the fewest models that would need to be moved to make room. Then find
  the locations to move them that create the least total distance moved.
  If multiple options yield the least distance - if one model is centered
  over another, for example - randomly determine the option to use.
  A model's facing does not change when the model is moved as a result
  of this rule.

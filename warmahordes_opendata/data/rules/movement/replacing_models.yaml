name: Replacing Models
description: >
  When replacing one model with another, place the new model
  so the area covered by the smaller of their bases is completely within
  the area covered by the larger. If the two bases are the same size, place
  the new model in the same location as the one being replaced. There must
  be room for the model's base in the location the model is placed. The
  player choosing the placed model's new location chooses its facing.

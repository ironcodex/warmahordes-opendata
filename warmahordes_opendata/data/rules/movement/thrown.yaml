  Sometimes models are thrown as the result of a spell or attack.
  When a model is thrown, refer to the spell or attack that caused the throw
  to determine the model's point of impact, generally directly away from
  the attacking model. When resolving a throw power attack, however, it
  may be necessary to roll for deviation to determine the thrown model's
  point of impact. Move the thrown model from its current location in a
  straight line directly toward the point of impact. During this movement,
  a thrown model moves through models with smaller bases without contacting
  them. Unlike when a model is slammed, rough terrain does not affect this
  movement, but the thrown model still stops if it contacts an obstacle,
  an obstruction, or a model with an equal or larger base. After moving,
  the thrown model becomes knocked down and contacts all models with which
  it is base-to-base and all models whose bases it overlaps. The thrown
  model then suffers a damage roll determined by the spell or attack that
  caused the throw.


  Add an additional die to the damage roll the thrown model suffers if it
  contacts an obstacle, an obstruction, or a model with an equal or larger
  base.


  If a thrown model contacts a model with an equal or smaller base, the
  contacted model becomes knocked down and suffers a collateral damage roll
  determined by the spell or attack that caused the throw. A contacted model
  with a larger base than the thrown model does not suffer collateral damage
  and is not knocked down. Resolve any collateral damage simultaneously
  with the damage resulting from the spell or attack that caused the throw.


  If a thrown model cannot be knocked down it must still forfeit its Normal
  Movement or Combat Action if it activates later in a turn in which it
  was thrown.

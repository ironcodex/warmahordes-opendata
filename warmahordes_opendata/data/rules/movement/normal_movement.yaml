description: >
  The first part of a model's activation is its Normal Movement.
  Models generally move only during this portion of their activations,
  though some special rules permit movement at other times.


  When a model resolves its Normal Movement, it must choose one of the
  following options:

  - Forfeit its Normal Movement

  - Aim

  - Full advance

  - Run

  - Charge


  Additionally some models can choose to perform a power attack encompassing
  its Normal Movement and Combat Action such as a slam or trample power attack.

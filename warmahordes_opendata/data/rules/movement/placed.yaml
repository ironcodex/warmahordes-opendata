name: Placed
description: >
  Sometimes models are placed in a new location as a result
  of a special rule or spell. Placing a model is not moving or advancing
  the model. Because a placed model did not advance, it cannot be targeted
  by free strikes. A model that is placed within an area, however, is considered
  to enter the area. There must be room for the model's base in the location
  the model is placed. A model cannot be placed in impassable terrain or
  with its base overlapping an obstacle, an obstruction, or another model's
  base. The player placing the model chooses its facing.


  When you are placing a friendly trooper model that is in formation, it
  must be placed in formation unless it is the unit commander. Unit commanders
  can be placed without considering formation.

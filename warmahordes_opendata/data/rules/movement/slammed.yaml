description: >
  Sometimes models are slammed as a result of a spell or attack.
  When a model is slammed, it is moved a certain distance directly away
  from the point of origin of the slam (usually the attacker), then becomes
  knocked down. The distance the slammed model is moved is determined by
  the spell or attack that caused the slam. The slammed model then suffers
  a damage roll determined by the spell or attack that caused the slam.
  A slammed model moves at half rate through rough terrain, suffers any
  damaging effects through which it passes, and stops if it contacts an
  obstacle, an obstruction, or a model with an equal or larger base. A slammed
  model moves through models with smaller bases than its own.


  Add an additional die to the damage roll the slammed model suffers if
  it contacts an obstacle, an obstruction, or a model with an equal or larger
  base.


  If a slammed model contacts a model with an equal or smaller base or moves
  through a model with a smaller base, the contacted model becomes knocked
  down and suffers a collateral damage roll determined by the spell or attack
  that caused the slam. A contacted model with a larger base does not suffer
  collateral damage and is not knocked down. Resolve any collateral damage
  simultaneously with the damage resulting from the spell or attack that
  caused the slam.


  If a slammed model cannot be knocked down it must still forfeit its Normal
  Movement or Combat Action if it activates later in a turn in which it
  was slammed.

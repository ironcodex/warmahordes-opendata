name: Charge
description: >
  The model rushes into melee range with a target and takes
  advantage of its momentum to make a more powerful first strike. A model
  that does not have a melee range or cannot make attacks also cannot
  charge. A model that forfeits its Combat Action cannot use its Normal
  Movement to charge that activation. A model cannot target a friendly
  model with a charge.


  Declare a charge and its target before moving the model. A model requires
  line of sight to another model to target it. After declaring a charge, the
  charging model turns to face any direction that will bring its target into
  its melee range when it moves, ignoring terrain, the distance to the charge
  target, and other models. The charging model then advances up to its current
  speed (SPD) plus 3" in that direction, in a straight line. The charging model
  cannot voluntarily stop its movement until its target is in its melee range,
  but after that point it can end this movement at any time. Once the charging
  model has the charge target in its melee range, it must keep the charge
  target in its melee range for the rest of the charge. The charging model
  stops if it contacts a model, an obstacle, or an obstruction or if it is
  pushed, slammed, thrown, or placed during its charge movement. If a model
  contacts a model, an obstacle, or an obstruction while charging but is able
  to move through it for some reason (such as a special rule on the model),
  the charging model does not stop but is still considered to have contacted
  the model, obstacle, or obstruction. At the end of the charge movement,
  the charging model turns to directly face its target.


  Some effects require a model to charge. If a model is required to charge and
  either it cannot or there are no legal charge targets in its line of sight,
  the model activates but must forfeit its Normal Movement and Combat Action.


  A charging model that is engaging its charge target at the end of its charge
  movement has made a successful charge. The charging model must use its Combat
  Action to make either initial melee attacks or a special attack with a melee
  weapon.


  The charging model's first melee attack after ending its charge movement must
  target the model it charged. If the charging model advanced at least 3", its
  first attack with a melee weapon targeting the model it charged is a charge
  attack. If that attack hits, the damage roll against the charge target is
  automatically boosted. After resolving its charge attack, the charging model
  completes its Combat Action normally.


  If a charging model moved less than 3", its first attack with a melee weapon
  is not a charge attack. Its first attack must still be made against the
  charge target, however.


  If a charging model ends its charge movement without its charge target
  in its melee range, it has made a failed charge. If a model makes a
  failed charge during its activation, its activation ends.


  Some models must meet special requirements to charge:

  - A warjack must spend 1 focus point to use its Normal Movement to charge.

  - A warbeast must be forced to use its Normal Movement to charge.

  - A trooper must receive the Press Forward order to use its Normal Movement
  to charge. A trooper that receives the Press Forward order must use its
  Normal Movement to either run or charge. Troopers in the same unit can charge
  the same target or multiple targets.


  Cavalry models have additional rules governing charges.


  If the charging model did not fail its charge and cannot make its first
  melee attack against the charge target, the charging model can make its first
  melee attack against another eligible target. In that case, its first melee
  attack damage roll is not automatically boosted.

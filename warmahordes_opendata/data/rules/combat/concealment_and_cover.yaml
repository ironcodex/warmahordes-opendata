name: Concealment & Cover
description: >
  Terrain features, spells, and other effects can make it more
  difficult to hit a model with a ranged or magic attack. A model within
  1" of an intervening terrain feature can gain either a concealment
  bonus or a cover bonus - depending on the type of terrain - to
  its DEF against ranged and magic attacks. If you can draw a line from
  any part of the attacker's volume to any part of the target model's
  volume and that line passes through a terrain feature, that terrain
  feature is intervening. Concealment and cover bonuses are not cumulative
  with themselves or each other, but they are cumulative with other effects
  that modify a model's DEF. In order to benefit from concealment or cover,
  the target model must be within 1" of that terrain feature along at
  least one straight line between it and the attacker. See "Terrain"
  on p. 86 for details on terrain features and how they provide concealment
  or cover.


  A model with concealment, either granted by being within
  1" of a terrain feature that provides concealment in relation to its
  attacker or from another effect, gains +2 DEF against ranged and magic
  attack rolls. Concealment provides no benefit against spray attacks.
  Examples of concealment- granting terrain features include low hedges
  and bushes.


  A model with cover, granted either by being within 1"
  of a terrain feature that provides cover in relation to its attacker
  or from another effect, gains +4 DEF against ranged and magic attack
  rolls. Cover provides no benefit against spray attacks. Examples of
  cover-granting terrain features include stone walls, giant boulders,
  and buildings.


  Remember, huge-based models never gain the DEF bonuses
  from concealment or cover.

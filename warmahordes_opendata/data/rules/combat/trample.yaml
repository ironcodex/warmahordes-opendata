description: >
  A model making a trample power attack crashes its way through
  small-based models in its path. A trample combines a model's Normal Movement
  and Combat Action. A model cannot make a trample power attack if it forfeited
  either its Normal Movement or its Combat Action.


  Declare a trample power attack at the beginning of the model's Normal
  Movement. Choose a direction in which you wish to trample, and turn the
  model to face that direction. The model then advances up to its current
  SPD plus 3" in a straight line in that direction. It moves through any
  small-based model in its path, but there must be room for the trampling
  model's base at the end of the movement. It stops if it contacts a model
  with a medium or larger base, an obstacle, or an obstruction. If a model
  contacts a model with a medium or larger base, an obstacle, or an obstruction
  while moving as part of a trample power attack but is able to move through
  it for some reason, the trampling model does not stop but is still considered
  to have contacted the model, obstacle, or obstruction. The trampling model
  cannot change its facing during or after this movement. Do not resolve
  free strikes against the trampling model during this movement.


  After the model has finished its trample movement, it makes a melee attack
  roll against each small-based model it moved through during this movement.
  Models hit by a trample attack suffer a power attack damage roll. These
  attacks are simultaneous. When a trampling model hits a model with a Buckler
  or a Shield or while a model is benefiting from the Shield Wall order,
  the hit model gains the shield, buckler, or Shield Wall ARM bonus only
  if the trampling model first contacted the model through its front arc.
  A trampling model gains a back strike bonus against a model only if the
  trampling model was completely in that model's back arc when it first
  contacted that model.


  Resolve free strikes against the trampling model after resolving all trample
  attacks. Small-based models contacted by the trampling model during its
  trample movement cannot make free strikes against the trampling model.
  Wait to resolve free strikes against the trampling model until after resolving
  all trample attacks. Ignore the distance between models when resolving
  free strikes against the trampling model; if a model was eligible to make
  a free strike against the trampling model during the trampling model's
  movement, it can do so whether or not the trampling model ended its movement
  in the eligible model's melee range.

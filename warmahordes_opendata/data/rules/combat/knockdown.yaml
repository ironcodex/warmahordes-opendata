name: Knockdown
description: >
  Some attacks and special rules cause a model to become knocked
  down. While knocked down, a model does not have a melee range and cannot
  advance, make special actions, make attacks, cast spells, use feats, or
  be used to channel a spell. A knocked down model does not engage other
  models and cannot be engaged by them. As a consequence, a model is never
  in melee with a knocked down model. A melee attack against a knocked down
  model automatically hits. A knocked down model has a base DEF of 5. A
  knocked down model does not block line of sight and is never an intervening
  model.


  A knocked down model can stand up at the start of its next activation
  unless it became knocked down during its controller's turn. In that case
  it cannot stand up until its controller's next turn, even if it has not
  yet activated this turn. A model cannot stand up during a turn it was
  knocked down. Knockdown is not cumulative; a model cannot become knocked
  down while it is knocked down.


  EXAMPLE: A model becomes knocked down during your opponent's turn, and
  before it gets a chance to stand up it is affected by an attack that would
  normally cause it to be knocked down. It is not affected by the second
  instance of knockdown, so it can still stand up on your turn.


  To stand up, a knocked down model forfeits either its Normal Movement
  or its Combat Action. A model that forfeits its Combat Action to stand
  can use its Normal Movement to make a full advance but cannot run, charge,
  or perform a slam or trample power attack that activation. When a model
  stands, it ceases to be knocked down.

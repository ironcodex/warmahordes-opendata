name: Free Strike
description: >
  When an engaged model advances out of an enemy's melee range
  or line of sight, the enemy model can make a free strike against it just
  before it leaves. The model makes one normal melee attack with any melee
  weapon that has sufficient melee range to reach the moving model and gains
  a +2 bonus to its attack roll. If the attack hits, the damage roll is
  boosted.


  When the free strike is made treat the free striking model as being in
  the advancing model's back arc. Free strikes do not benefit from the
  back strike bonus.


  When a model with the Gunfighter advantage makes a free strike with a
  ranged weapon, it only gains the +2 to hit bonus against the model targeted
  by the attack. Likewise, if the attack hits, the damage roll against the
  model targeted by the free strike attack is boosted.

name: Stationary
description: >
  Some attacks and special rules cause a model to become stationary.
  While stationary a model does not have a melee range and cannot advance,
  make special actions, make attacks, cast spells, use feats, be used to
  channel a spell, or give orders. A stationary model does not engage other
  models and cannot be engaged by them. As a consequence, a model is never
  in melee with a stationary model. A melee attack against a stationary
  model automatically hits. A stationary model has a base DEF of 5.

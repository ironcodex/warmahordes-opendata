title: Targeting a Model in Melee
description: >
  A large-or-smaller-based model in melee gains +4 DEF against
  non-spray ranged and magic attacks. Huge-based models never gain the Target
  in Melee DEF bonus.\n
  \n
  Ignore the target-in-melee DEF bonus when the point of origin of the ranged
  or magic attack is in melee with the model the attack roll is being made
  against.

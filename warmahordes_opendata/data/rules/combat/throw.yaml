description: >
  A model making a throw power attack picks up and throws another
  model. A warjack must have at least one non-crippled weapon with the Open
  Fist weapon quality to make a throw power attack. A warbeast must have
  at least one weapon with the Open Fist weapon quality to make a throw
  power attack. A throw power attack has a melee range equal to the melee
  range of its non-crippled weapon with Open Fist. A model cannot throw
  power attack a model with a larger base; that is, a model with a larger
  base cannot be targeted.


  The attacking model must first attempt to grasp the model it intends to
  throw by making a melee attack roll against it. If the attack hits, that
  model is grasped and tries to break free before it is lifted off the ground.
  Both models roll a d6 and add their current STR. An attacker with two
  non-crippled weapons with Open Fist rolls 2d6 instead. If the grasped
  model's total is greater, it breaks free and the attack ends. If the
  attacker's total equals or exceeds the grasped model's total, the grasped
  model is thrown.


  When your model throws another model, you can choose either to throw the
  model directly away from the attacker or to throw it at another model
  within the attacker's line of sight. The throw distance is equal to half
  the attacker's current STR in inches.


  If you choose to have your model throw a model at another model, ignore
  the model being thrown when determining line of sight to the target. The
  target can have a larger base than the attacker. If the distance between
  the thrown model and the model it is being thrown at is beyond the throw
  distance, the point of impact is the point along the line from the thrown
  model to the model it is being thrown at equal to the throw distance.
  In this case, do not roll deviation. If the other model is within the
  throw distance, the attacker makes a melee attack roll against it. On
  a hit, move the thrown model from its current location directly toward
  the other model's base until it contacts the target.


  If the target was in the throw range and the attack roll resulted in a
  miss, determine the thrown model's actual point of impact by rolling
  for deviation. Referencing the deviation rules, roll a d6 for direction
  and a d3 for distance in inches. Measure deviation from the center of
  the missed model's base. The deviation distance cannot exceed half the
  distance between the thrown model and the model that was missed.


  When moving the thrown model, it moves through the throwing model without
  contacting it.


  The thrown model suffers a power attack damage roll.

description: >
  A model making a slam power attack rams a model with the full
  force of its body to send the target model flying backward and knock
  it to the ground. A slam combines a model's Normal Movement and Combat
  Action. A model cannot make a slam power attack if it forfeited either
  its Normal Movement or its Combat Action that activation.


  A slam power attack made by a colossal or gargantuan has a 2" melee range.
  A slam power attack made by any other model has a 0.5" melee range.


  A model making a slam power attack during its activation can attempt
  to slam any model that is in its line of sight at the beginning of its
  Normal Movement. Declare a slam and its target before moving the slamming
  model. Remember, a model requires line of sight to another model to
  target it. After declaring a slam, turn the slamming model to directly
  face the slam target. The slamming model then advances its full SPD
  plus 3" directly toward its target. The slamming model cannot voluntarily
  stop its movement unless its target is in its melee range, but it can
  end this movement at any point with its target in its slam power attack's
  melee range. It stops if it contacts a model, an obstacle, or an obstruction
  or if it is pushed, slammed, thrown, or placed during its slam movement.
  If a model contacts a model, an obstacle, or an obstruction while moving
  as part of a slam power attack but is able to move through it for some
  reason, the slamming model does not stop but is still considered to
  have contacted the model, obstacle, or obstruction.


  The slamming model cannot change its facing after advancing as part of a
  slam.


  A slamming model that ends its slam movement with its target in the melee
  range of its slam power attack has made a successful slam. If the slamming
  model advanced at least 3", it makes a melee attack roll against its
  target. A model that slam power attacks a model with a larger base suffers
  -2 to its attack roll. If the attack hits, the target is slammed
  d6" directly away from the attacker, becomes knocked down, and then
  suffers a power attack damage roll.


  If the slamming model has a smaller
  base than the model it slammed, the slammed model is slammed half the
  distance rolled.


  Smaller-based models hit by a slam power attack made by a huge-based model
  are moved an additional 2".


  If a slamming model makes a successful slam but moved less than 3", the model
  still makes an attack roll against its target. If the target is hit, it
  suffers a power attack damage roll but is not slammed. These are still slam
  attack rolls and slam damage rolls.


  A model that does not end its slam movement with its target within its slam
  melee range has failed its slam power attack. If a model fails its slam power
  attack during its activation, its activation ends.

factions: [grymkin]

name: Dark Menagerie

flavor: >
  Each of the Defiers has some special preference for how to unmake Menoth's
  twisted civilization. When the opportunity to strike arises, a Defier gathers
  a dark menagerie of his or her worst nightmares in a terrifying show of force.
  Towering beasts of twisted flesh and bounding swarms of frightful creatures
  gather together to enact the Defier's will, leaving behind only a handful of
  demented survivors to spread word of the host of shadows that emerged from the
  night.

flavor: >
  The worshipers of the clockwork goddess have conceived of the most
  technologically advanced machines in existence. Armed with impressive
  firepower and fueled by energy sources well beyond the understanding of even
  the greatest minds in the Iron Kingdoms, the vectors of the Convergence
  of Cyriss turn hard targets into shrapnel and smash through infantry
  formations with whirring blades and spiked fists. Endless swarms of servitors
  dart among these complex automatons while the mortal priests of the machine
  cult risk their flesh in service to their goddess to keep these machines at
  peak performance.

  clarification: >
    When a friendly model is directly hit by a non-spray ranged attack during
    your opponent's turn while within 3" of a model with Shield Guard, you can
    choose to have the model with Shield Guard directly hit instead. It is
    automatically hit and suffers all damage and effects. A model can use Shield
    Guard only once per round and cannot use Shield Guard if it is incorporeal,
    knocked down, or stationary.

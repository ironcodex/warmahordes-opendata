factions: [protectorate]

name: The Creator's Might

flavor: >
  The word of the Creator of Man is law, and by the will of the faithful his
  designs are made material. The clergy of the Protectorate march to war arrayed
  as an army worthy of Menoth, channeling the power of Menite relics that
  predate the priest-kings while chanting prayers drawn from holy writ and
  ancient inscriptions. Their mighty sanctified machines rumble across the
  battlefield to clash with those who would deny the glory of Menoth. Great
  wheels bearing the weight of consecrated edifices grind ever onward,
  accompanied by the hymns of warpriests. In righteous splendor, Menoth's most
  devout servants go forth to battle blessed by his might.

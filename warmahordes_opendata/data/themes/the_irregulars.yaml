name: The Irregulars

flavor: >
  Some mercenary contracts offer jobs so desperate, so vile, or so insane that
  no right-minded group of sell-swords would ever consider taking them. For the
  employers who offer these contracts, it is fortunate that the Iron Kingdoms
  has no shortage of mercenary companies full of the desperate, the vile, and
  the insane. When such undesirable jobs appear, they attract an unlikely
  assortment of mercs willing to do anything, no matter the odds of survival,
  for another fistful of coin.

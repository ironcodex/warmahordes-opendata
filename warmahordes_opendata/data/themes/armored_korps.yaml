factions: [khador]

name: Armored Korps

flavor: >
  With a hiss of steam and the tread of iron, the heavily armored infantry of
  Khador march to war with heavy warjacks at their side. Though Khador lacks
  the light warjacks of other nations, they make up for it with a dedicated
  corps of soldiers who go to war in steam-powered armor. Few opponents possess
  the weaponry able to chew through so thick a wall of armor, allowing the
  Man-O-War to crush enemy emplacements.

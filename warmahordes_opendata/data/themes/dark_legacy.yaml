factions: [infernals]

name: Dark Legacy

flavor: >
  As an ancient pact reaches its moment of reckoning, horrifying forces from
  beyond comprehension descend upon the world to collect. With traitorous
  mortals as their momentary tools, Infernal Masters bring their nightmares to
  battle for every soul they believe is their due. Though few would have
  suspected the terrible legacy that would follow that pact, many will pay for
  it as the Infernals move among them.

    Ambush - You can choose not to deploy a unit with Ambush at the start of the
    game. If it is not deployed normally, you can put it into play at the end of
    any of your Control Phases after your first turn. When you do, choose any
    table edge except the back of your opponent's deployment zone. Place all
    models in the unit with Ambush in formation completely within 3" of the
    chosen table edge.

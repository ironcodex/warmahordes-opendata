factions: [legion]

name: Children of the Dragon

flavor: >
  Reshaped by the dragon's power, the blighted Nyss serve as formidable fighters
  within Everblight's legion. Utterly devoted to the dragon, whole shards
  sometimes join battle together to enact their master's will. Such highly
  skilled and self-sufficient forces strike fast and hard with a combination of
  blade, claw, and bow. Supported by agile dragonspawn and powerful nephilim,
  these Nyss shards can strike anywhere the dragon directs them, moving
  unnoticed through enemy territory to secure objectives while outmaneuvering
  larger armies.

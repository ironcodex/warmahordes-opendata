factions: [retribution]

name: Defenders of Ios

flavor: >
  When Ios itself is threatened, the Homeguard Coalition leverages the assets of
  all the hallytyr to form an army made up of the diverse forces of houseguard
  warriors and the combined might of countless Iosan houses. Bringing together
  combatants of many varied talents and unique specializations, these mixed
  forces have joined the Retribution and can rival the martial power of even the
  national armies of the Iron Kingdoms. They fight not only for the creed of the
  Retribution but for the sanctity of Ios and the lives of its people.

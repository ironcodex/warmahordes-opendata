flavor: >
  The Order of the Golden Crucible is jealous of its secrets. Its members have
  experienced firsthand what can happen when their alchemical and mechanikal
  innovations fall into the wrong hands. The most technologically advanced
  divisions of the Crucible Guard are insular and allow no outsiders, lest
  their secrets be stolen. Wielding the newest and most devastating weapons in
  the Guard's arsenal, they bring destruction to enemies of the Order.

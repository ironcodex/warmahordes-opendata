factions: [cygnar]

name: Heavy Metal

flavor: >
  Although Cygnar generally prefers a combined-arms approach to conflict, when
  its advanced warjacks are massed on the field under the control of a skilled
  warcaster, they are a match for any enemy. Such large, self-sufficient
  battlegroups are typically deployed to besiege fixed positions or to meet
  concentrations of enemy armor and heavy infantry on the battlefield. Where
  Cygnar faces deeply entrenched or armored foes, the tread of its mighty
  machines shakes the earth, and its storm technology blackens the sky.

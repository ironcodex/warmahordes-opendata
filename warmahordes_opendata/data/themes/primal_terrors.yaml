flavor: >
  When the blighted ogrun tribes go to war, they do so with the blessings of
  Everblight by their side. Fighting with little regard for personal safety,
  howling warbands descend upon their foes, crazed by the prospect of spilling
  blood for their war chiefs and their korune, Thagrosh. Even mortal wounds
  suffered in battle do not deter them. Instead, such injuries goad them to
  drive even deeper into the enemy's heart to shed even more blood before they
  expire.

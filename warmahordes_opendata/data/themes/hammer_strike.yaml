  Fighting in the wars of the Iron Kingdoms has allowed the mercenaries of Rhul
  to stay apprised of the ongoing struggles abroad. These sell- swords fatten
  the coffers of mercenary clans and receive valuable combat experience against
  a variety of opponents. Numerous such clans offer the might of Rhulic 'jacks
  and veteran warriors to those who can afford their asking price. Together,
  they crush enemy armies to dust beneath the tread of their machines and an
  unceasing rain of hammer blows.

factions: [trollbloods]

name: Band of Heroes

flavor: >
  Kriels maintain martial traditions that go back to the beginning of the
  trollkin as a people. Armed with axe and shield, kriel warriors have long
  waged bloody wars to keep ownership of their lands, and their tales of valor
  are carved into the faces of krielstones to inspire those generations that
  follow in their footsteps. These bands of warriors give rise to new champions,
  who earn their acclaim in battle against the enemies of the trollkin. They
  emerge from the wilderness in a tide of steel and stone to strike down all who
  stand before them.

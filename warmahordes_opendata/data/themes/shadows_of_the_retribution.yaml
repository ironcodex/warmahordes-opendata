factions: [retribution]

name: Shadows of the Retribution

flavor: >
  The Retribution of Scyrah is most adept at striking from the shadows. Its mage
  hunters traditionally undertake clandestine missions executed by solo
  operatives and small teams of elite and dedicated warriors. On rare occasions,
  however, a show of force is required, and to that end the Retribution
  assembles stealthy armies comprised of seasoned mage hunters and powerful
  myrmidons. Experienced in swift and brutal combat, they skillfully orchestrate
  surprise attacks and take the enemy unaware.

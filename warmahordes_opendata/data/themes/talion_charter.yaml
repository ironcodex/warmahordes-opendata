factions: [mercenaries]

name: Talion Charter

flavor: >
  The Talion Charter originally set out the terms and conditions for those
  serving on the Talion, a ship crewed largely by men and women brought together
  by mutiny and who turned to piracy for survival. It has been expanded to serve
  as a rallying point for a motley assortment of powerful and well-armed pirates
  and privateers. These include several notable warcasters-for-hire such as
  Phinneus Shae, the Talion's captain; Captain Bartolo "Broadsides Bart"
  Montador of the Calamitas; and the Thamarite sorceress Fiona the Black. The
  sell-swords of the Talion Charter have proven they can stand on equal footing
  with any mercenary company in western Immoren and offer their services at
  quite reasonable rates, both on land and at sea.

  clarification: >
    Sacrificial Pawn [Sea Dog model] - When a model with Sacrificial Pawn [Sea
    Dog model] is directly hit by an enemy ranged attack, you can have one
    friendly, non-incorporeal Sea Dog trooper model within 3" of it directly hit
    instead. That model is automatically hit and suffers all damage and effects.

- description: >
    After models are deployed at the start of the game, you can place up to two
    3" AOEs anywhere on the table at least 6" away from the nearest enemy model.
    These AOES are hazards and rough terrain that remain in play for the first
    round of the game. A model entering or ending its activation in one of these
    AOEs suffers an unboostable POW 12 blast damage roll.

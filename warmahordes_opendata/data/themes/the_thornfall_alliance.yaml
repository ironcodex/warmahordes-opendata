factions: [minions]

name: The Thornfall Alliance

flavor: >
  Once, the farrow tribes of Immoren were scattered, but a summit of gathered
  chiefs sealed an alliance in blood oaths at an old battleground called
  Thornfall. The foremost of those gathered, the ambitious warlord Lord Carver,
  cowed the rest into submitting to his violent visions of conquest. Where Lord
  Carver travels, lesser farrow chieftains are intimidated into obedience, and
  other great farrow warlords have taken up his banner. Backed by the mad genius
  of the human Dr. Arkadius and his surgically enhanced warbeasts, the Thornfall
  Alliance is poised to strike fear into the hearts of the civilized kingdoms.

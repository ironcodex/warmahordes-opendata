name: Winds of Death

flavor: >
  Although hoksune emphasizes melee combat above other forms of war, the armies
  of the skorne have been forced to adapt in order to combat the long-ranged
  capabilities of their western adversaries. New armies composed almost entirely
  of Venators are being drawn up for the first time to battle the enemy on equal
  footing, giving these low-caste warriors an esteem they have never before
  experienced. The ranged weapons of the Venators fill the air with clouds of
  razor-sharp needles and rain down death on the enemy with chymical ammunition
  and the artillery of heavy weapon crews.

  clarification: >
    Reposition [3"] - At the end of an activation it did not run or fail a
    charge, a model with Reposition [3"] can advance up to 3", then its
    activation ends.

- description: >
    Before models are deployed at the start of the game, you can place one wall
    template anywhere completely within 20" of the rear table edge of your
    deployment zone. The template cannot be placed within 3" of a hill,
    obstacle, or obstruction. The template is an obstacle that grants cover.

factions: [protectorate]

name: Exemplar Interdiction

flavor: >
  The ruling priesthood and scrutators of the Protectorate of Menoth have no
  more loyal and steadfast protectors and warriors than the Exemplars. Large
  interdictions of the theocracy's formidable heavy infantry and cavalry knights
  are often assembled to serve the Great Crusade, sent against the unbelievers
  to prove the futility of standing against blessed steel wielded with
  conviction. Such an interdiction never wavers in fulfilling its orders, as
  obedience to the clergy is their unbreakable creed. The great machines
  marching with them are similarly implacable, empowered by blessings both
  inscribed on their hulls and filling the air as choir voices rise to drown out
  the lamentations of heretics crushed underfoot.

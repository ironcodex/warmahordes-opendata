factions: [minions]

name: Will work for Food

flavor: >
  One constant is true across the Iron Kingdoms: everybody needs to eat. In lean
  times, many of the wild peoples of western Immoren are willing to put aside
  their differences and work together for mutual survival. The primal need to
  eat and endure becomes a particular challenge when one's closest companions
  are enormous and voracious warbeasts. Larger armed groups of wilderness
  warriors might muster to offer their services in exchange for food, weapons,
  or other barter to see them through the lean months. For some, the most
  eagerly anticipated treasure is the great volume of meat that can be butchered
  from the fallen and consumed in the aftermath of battle.

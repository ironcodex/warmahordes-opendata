factions: [trollbloods]

name: The Power of Dhunia

flavor: >
  The trollkin are never closer to their goddess Dhunia than when walking beside
  the shamans and runeshapers who work their magic through the will of the Great
  Mother. Drawing upon their deep connection to earth and stone, trollkin
  mystics shape the battlefield to their will and manipulate the arcane might
  flowing through their very veins to mobilize a great number of true trolls
  lured by the power of the goddess. This close connection passes to the mighty
  trolls who then accompany the trollkin. The touch of Dhunia soothes the
  trolls' minds and keeps their hunger for flesh in check as it suffuses their
  bodies with her bountiful powers of regeneration.

  The true might of the Nightmare Empire lies in its endless tide of undead
  thralls and the power of its helljacks. Cryxian forces overwhelm their
  opponents and bury the living in a swarm of reanimated soldiers. It is in the
  midst of these shambling masses that Cryx delivers its formidable helljacks,
  shielded by a wall of flesh and repurposed steel. Such tactics are most
  effective at eliminating durable targets concealed deep within the enemy's
  ranks while burying lesser armies under the weight of numbers.

  clarification: >
    Ambush - You can choose not to deploy a unit with Ambush at the start of the
    game. If it is not deployed normally, you can put it into play at the end of
    any of your Control Phases after your first turn. When you do, choose any
    table edge except the back of your opponent's deployment zone. Place the
    unit with Ambush completely within 3" of the chosen table edge.

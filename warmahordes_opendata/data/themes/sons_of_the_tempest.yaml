flavor: >
  Mobile and versatile, the Arcane Tempest are called upon to deal with
  situations beyond the capacity of standard military forces, particularly
  arcane threats that are warded against conventional firepower. Coordinated by
  experienced gun mages to fight in conjunction with traditional battlegroups,
  these strike teams can operate in any theater of war. As their ranked guns
  tear apart the enemy with fusillades of deadly firepower, lone marksmen pick
  off high-priority targets with speed and accuracy.

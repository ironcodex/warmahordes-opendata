name: The Vengeance of Dhunia

flavor: >
  The Trollbloods have suffered for decades at the hands of outsiders, and the
  infernal invasion was yet another human atrocity that punished the kriels. The
  infernals had not come to Caen for their souls, but the cosmic horrors still
  slaughtered the children of Dhunia whenever their forces crossed paths.


  During this turmoil, the trollkin rose to the occasion and organized a proper
  military operation to force the infernals out of trollkin lands and far away
  from the worshippers of Dhunia. Wartime peace treaties have been negotiated
  with other non-trollkin Dhunia worshippers, such as the savage farrow,
  producing the greatest army the enemies of the kriels have ever faced.

factions: [cryx]

name: The Ghost Fleet

flavor: >
  The cursed pirates of the Ghost Fleet are locked in undeath. Nothing can
  destroy the revenants bound to Captain Rengrave so long as the blighted fires
  of the black ship Atramentous still burn, and the ghostly crews of countless
  wraith ships cannot be touched by the mundane weapons of men. The undead
  armada terrorizes coastal towns and port cities and preys upon the vessels of
  every nation that dares sail the waters of the Meredius. The Ghost Fleet is
  responsible not only for harassing targets but also for distracting the
  mainlanders so that the Nightmare Empire might conduct its more sensitive
  operations in relative secrecy.

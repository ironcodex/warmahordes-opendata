factions: [skorne]

name: Masters of War

flavor: >
  Conflict is to be savored, for battle is the only true chance to prove one's
  devotion to the hoksune code. Though the martial orders of Cataphracts and
  Praetorians disagree on which best exemplifies the martial code of the skorne,
  they equally embrace the opportunity to demonstrate their adherence to it.
  Acting on the orders of their tyrants, these disciplined warriors grab the
  enemy army by its throat and do not relent until the foe is vanquished or they
  have been claimed by the Void.

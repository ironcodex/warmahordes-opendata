factions: [legion]

name: Oracles of Annihilation

flavor: >
  There is great power buried alongside the relics of the past, and the
  arcanists who serve the dragon are well- versed in the history of the ancient
  world, receiving necessary knowledge directly from Everblight himself. These
  arcanists scour the ruins of lost civilizations, seeking to recover useful
  artifacts from their sacred places to aid Everblight's cause. When met with
  resistance, they combine fighting skill and specialized arcane knowledge to
  best their opponents, and the flesh and blood of fallen foes are quickly
  harvested and brought to the spawning vessels, there to lend further strength
  to Everblight's legion.

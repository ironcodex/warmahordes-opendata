  If war is good for business, then business has been very good to the Steelhead
  mercenary company. Already one of the largest groups of sell-swords in western
  Immoren before the fall of Llael, subsequent years of warfare have seen them
  reach peak profitability. Steelheads can be found in nearly every major
  engagement from Skirov to Imer, bringing victory-or anonymous defeat-at
  reasonable prices. The company's regular presence on the battlefield often
  sees them work alongside many notable freelancers and experts. The old adage
  holds true: "Either as allies or enemies, the Steelheads are gonna cost you."

special_rules:
- description: >
    If Ace is included in this army, it is a friendly Mercenary model instead of
    a Cygnar warjack.

- description: Solos in this army gain Mark Target.
  clarification: >
    Mark Target - Other friendly Faction models gain +2 to ranged attack rolls
    against enemy models within 5" of a model with Marked Target and in its LOS.

- description: Steelhead cavalry models in this army gain Bulldoze.
  clarification: >
    Bulldoze - When a model with Bulldoze is B2B with an enemy model during its
    Normal Movement, it can push that model up to 2" directly away from it. A
    model can be pushed by Bulldoze only once per turn. Bulldoze has no effect
    when a model makes a trample power attack.

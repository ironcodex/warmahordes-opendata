factions: [cygnar]

name: Storm Division

flavor: >
  Cygnar's Storm Division is an autonomous military force that delivers the
  flash of lightning and the roll of thunder to the battlefields of Immoren. The
  division couples the latest voltaic weaponry and hardware produced by the
  Cygnaran Armory with the service of skilled soldiers. More Storm Knights serve
  in the Storm Division than in any other force in Cygnar, and with the aid of
  accomplished stormsmiths, these elite warriors make up a highly mobile army
  capable of bringing the fury of the storm to Cygnar's enemies.

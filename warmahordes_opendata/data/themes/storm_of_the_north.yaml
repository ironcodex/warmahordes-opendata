factions: [trollbloods]

name: Storm of the North

flavor: >
  For generations, the Northkin have stood as disparate clans, fighting one
  another as often as they battled the many rivals who surround them. For the
  first time in centuries, however, these hardy northern folk now fight for a
  common purpose. Resilient warriors wage war alongside the legendary warbeasts
  of the trollkin, while powerful warlocks wield arcane might to enhance the
  battle prowess of their warbands. All opposition is crushed beneath the
  Northkin onslaught or is frozen and shattered by the power of winter itself.

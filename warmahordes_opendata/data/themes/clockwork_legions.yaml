factions: [convergence]

name: Clockwork Legions

flavor: >
  There are few things more disconcerting than facing a legion of Convergence
  soldiers who have achieved transcendence-metal- bodied warriors who go to
  battle in silence and act in unison with mathematical perfection. While such a
  pitiless metallic army is terrifying to face in its own right, any living
  devotees to the Maiden of Gears can be even more frightening. Their desire to
  prove their worthiness to ascend into a clockwork shell drives them to acts of
  fanatical devotion and unhinged violence.

factions: [skorne]

name: The Exalted

flavor: >
  As silent as the death that will never embrace them, the exalted ancestors of
  the skorne strike fear into the enemies of the Empire. Guided not by a
  Tyrant's whims but instead by their own unknowable understanding, the exalted
  go to war accompanied by ranks of their immortal companions. Their reasons for
  marching to battle are known only to them and to the few they choose to
  communicate with through the extollers who speak on their behalf.

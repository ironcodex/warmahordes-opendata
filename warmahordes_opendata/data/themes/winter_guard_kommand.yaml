name: Winter Guard Kommand

flavor: >
  The ranks of the Winter Guard are the patriotic backbone of the Khadoran Army.
  Hardened by a rigorous training regimen and driven by their love for the
  Motherland, these soldiers march against the enemies of the Empire. They make
  every effort to see the will of the empress done, whether pushing deep into
  hostile territory under the cover of withering artillery fire or giving their
  lives to defend Khador from those who would threaten its sovereignty.

    Sacrificial Pawn [Winter Guard trooper model] is directly hit by an enemy
    ranged attack, you can have one friendly, non-incorporeal Winter Guard
    trooper model within 3" of it directly hit instead. That model is
    automatically hit and suffers all damage and effects.

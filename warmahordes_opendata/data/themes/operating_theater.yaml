  The inscrutable cephalyx tirelessly perform diabolical experiments on their

  clarification: >

    enemy attack anytime except while it is advancing, after the attack is
    resolved it can immediately make a full advance directly toward the
    attacking model.

  clarification: >
    Rise - If a model with Rise is knocked down at the beginning of your
    Maintenance Phase, it stands up.

- description: One Cephalyx Mind Slaver & Drudge unit in this army gains Ambush.
  clarification: >
    Ambush - You can choose not to deploy a unit with Ambush at the start of the
    game. If it is not deployed normally, you can put it into play at the end of
    any of your Control Phases after your first turn. When you do, choose any
    table edge except the back of your opponent's deployment zone. Place the
    unit with Ambush completely within 3" of the chosen table edge.

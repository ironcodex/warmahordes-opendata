name: Jaws of the Wolf

flavor: >
  The deployment of warjack-heavy forces to eliminate hard targets is a standard
  response to military threats. A common Khadoran tactic involves augmenting
  such forces with a contingent of scouts, who venture ahead to ensure the slow
  and steady column of Khadoran steel reaches its target intact. Once engaged,
  the warjacks rely on overwhelming strength and raw firepower to batter the
  enemy into submission.

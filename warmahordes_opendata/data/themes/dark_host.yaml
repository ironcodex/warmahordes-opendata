flavor: >
  Torn from the horrors of the void and given new forms in the bodies of the
  dead, banes are dark and sinister warriors in the service of Cryx. Far from
  mindless, they possess a military cunning mixed with an utter malevolence to
  life. Supported by potent necromancers, armies of banes beset the enemy like a
  tide of darkness and death.

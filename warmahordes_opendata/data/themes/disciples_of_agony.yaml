  Connected by a desire to wring power from pain, the students of the ancient
  skorne master Morkaash show the enemies of the Empire the subtlety of their
  unique arts. Potent mortitheurges, indomitable Nihilator cultists, and
  talented paingivers work in concert to bring low all living flesh that opposes
  them. Captured enemies who prove useful are kept as subjugated warriors, while
  all others taken alive are introduced to new depths of suffering at the barbs
  and blades of their captors.


  At the heart of a skorne cohort is its warhost-a crushing wall of warbeasts
  whipped into frenzy by the barbed lashes of the paingivers. Acting as an
  unbreakable core around which the rest of an army moves, this formation is
  directed by the most skilled warlocks in the cohort, often supported by those
  with less experience directing warbeasts. With tusk, fang, and claw, the
  towering beasts of the host tear enemies to pieces or trample them underfoot
  in their maddened assaults. Each warhost strikes at the hardest points of a
  defender's lines and grinds them to pulp beneath an unrelenting advance.

  clarification: >
    Sacrificial Pawn [Minion warrior model] - When a model with Sacrificial Pawn
    [Minion warrior model] is directly hit by an enemy ranged attack, you can
    have one friendly, non-incorporeal Minion warrior model within 3" of it
    directly hit instead. That model is automatically hit and suffers all damage
    and effects.

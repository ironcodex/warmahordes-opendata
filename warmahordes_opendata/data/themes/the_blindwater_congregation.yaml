factions: [minions]

name: The Blindwater Congregation

flavor: >
  The gatormen of Blindwater Lake are the core of a vast reptilian cult
  dedicated to its self-made deity, Bloody Barnabas. Once their leader, this
  ancient warrior and mystic elevated himself to godhood on a tide of bloodshed.
  As the pragmatic bokor Calaban guides the congregation from the shadows,
  gatormen from across the region assemble alongside the bog trogs and other
  swamp creatures subjugated into fighting alongside them in Barnabas' name.

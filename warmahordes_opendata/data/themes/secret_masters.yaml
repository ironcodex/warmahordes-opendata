  The blackclads are few in number, but their work is constant and endless. Only
  a small handful of these druids can be devoted to any single task at a given
  time. But the masters of the wilderness are cunning. They have woven a web of
  many debts among the inhabitants of the wilderness, whom they can call upon to
  fight on their behalf.

  clarification: >
    Sacrificial Pawn [Minion warrior model] - When a model with Sacrificial Pawn
    [Minion warrior model] is directly hit by an enemy ranged attack, you can
    have one friendly, non-incorporeal Minion warrior model within 3" of it
    directly hit instead. That model is automatically hit and suffers all damage
    and effects.

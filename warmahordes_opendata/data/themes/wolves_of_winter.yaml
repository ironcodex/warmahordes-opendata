  The Greylords Covenant does not shrink from using any weapon at its disposal,
  no matter how horrifying. This fact is seldom made clearer than when a task
  force of Greylord arcanists goes to battle with a retinue of blood-mad Doom
  Reavers bearing profane fellblades, cursed objects based on the weapons of the
  Orgoth slavers. Greylords will not hesitate to unleash their insane soldiers
  upon any foe, with little regard for the collateral damage they may cause.

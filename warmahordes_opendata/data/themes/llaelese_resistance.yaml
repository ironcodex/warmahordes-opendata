factions: [mercenaries]

name: Llaelese Resistance

flavor: >
  The beleaguered soldiers of the Llaelese Resistance are mercenaries only by
  necessity, taking contracts to help pay the enormous costs of their rebellion.
  Since the fall of Merywyn, many Llaelese noblemen have helped from exile to
  fund the Resistance. They leave field operations to individuals like the
  warcaster Ashlynn d'Elyse, who fights an endless war against the Khadorans who
  invaded her homeland and killed her father. To some, the likelihood of
  restoring Llael seems remote, and they have turned their attention to pure
  vengeance, willing to give their lives to force a reckoning.

    one small-or-medium-based solo completely within the AOE.

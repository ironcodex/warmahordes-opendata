name: The Kingmaker's Army

flavor: >
  In 609 AR, Asheth Magnus set about organizing the greatest mercenary army ever
  gathered in one place. Having taken Vinter Raelthorne IV's bastard son Julius
  under his wing, the Warlord embarked on an ambitious plan to secure Cygnar's
  throne. This army was bankrolled with gold bullion stolen from the Cygnaran
  Army as well as other spoils, coin Magnus spent wisely. He purchased the first
  Galleon colossals produced by Black Anchor Heavy Industries, hired a portion
  of Captain Bartolo Montador's pirate fleet, recruited every available
  Steelhead company he could find, and enlisted the services of other skilled
  warcasters and formidable specialists, several wanted for high crimes in
  Cygnar. This army proved that Magnus' reputation as a mercenary warlord was
  well deserved and played a pivotal role in the outcome of the Second Cygnaran
  Civil War.

    Ambush - You can choose not to deploy a unit with Ambush at the start of the
    game. If it is not deployed normally, you can put it into play at the end of
    any of your Control Phases after your first turn. When you do, choose any
    table edge except the back of your opponent's deployment zone. Place the
    unit with Ambush completely within 3" of the chosen table edge.

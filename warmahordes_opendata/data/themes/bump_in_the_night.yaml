factions: [grymkin]

name: Bump in the Night

flavor: >
  The grymkin are not an organized military force. They do not come to battle in
  regimented formations; indeed, they attack with scarcely any perceivable order
  at all. When a mass of motley grymkin lumber to war in the service of their
  masters, they advance as a haphazard but terrifying horde. Descending upon a
  vice-ridden population, they indulge in their unique appetites as they demand
  their due of wicked humanity.

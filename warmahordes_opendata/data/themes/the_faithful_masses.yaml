factions: [protectorate]

name: The Faithful Masses

flavor: >
  The strength of the Protectorate of Menoth is not restricted to its foundries
  and garrisons but is found in the hearts and souls of the numberless devotees
  to its faith. Every person who fears and serves the Creator of Man is another
  potential soldier to defend the theocracy. Pious citizen soldiers minimally
  trained as militia often go to battle accompanied by more elite lesser martial
  orders, such as the Paladins of the Order of the Wall and the Allegiants of
  the Order of the Fist, who consider their service a life's calling. These
  forces are often joined by members of the ominous Reclaimant Order, who
  protect the bodies and spirits of the faithful masses as they fight in
  Menoth's name.

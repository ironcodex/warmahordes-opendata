factions: [protectorate]

name: Guardians of the Temple

flavor: >
  The soldiers of the Flameguard Temple once found their purpose in defending
  the sacred sites of the Protectorate, but the turmoil of recent years has seen
  these former guardians forged into one of the most formidable fighting forces
  of the nation. Hearing and heeding Menoth's call to service, thousands have
  swelled the ranks to take up arms and carry out the will of the Lawgiver. With
  the blessings of Menoth upon them, these faithful eagerly go to war against
  the non-believers, unified in their unwavering support of the Great Crusade.

  clarification: >
    Ambush - You can choose not to deploy a unit with Ambush at the start of the
    game. If it is not deployed normally, you can put it into play at the end of
    any of your Control Phases after your first turn. When you do, choose any
    table edge except the back of your opponent's deployment zone. Place all
    models in the unit with Ambush in formation completely within 3" of the
    chosen table edge.

  The enemy of my enemy is my ally. This is understood as the salvation of
  humanity among the forces of the Church of Morrow that have come together to
  halt the Infernal procession descending upon the Iron Kingdoms. Driven by the
  common bond of their religion, forces that might otherwise turn on one another
  find they are stronger together, and by setting aside their differences, they
  can save one another alongside everyone else in the path of evil.

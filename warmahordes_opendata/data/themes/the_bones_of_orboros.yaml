factions: [circle]

name: The Bones of Orboros

flavor: >
  Since the order's inception, the blackclads of the Circle Orboros have passed
  down the secrets of shaping and animating wood and stone to do their bidding
  as wolds. The product of ancient rites and blood sacrifices, these massive
  stone constructs patrol the old places of the world and ensure the sacred
  sites of the order remain untouched by outsiders, falling upon intruders
  without hesitation to crush them under fist and foot. The druids also summon
  forth these stone constructs to batter into submission those threats too large
  or well- defended to succumb to the Circle's traditional hit-and-run tactics,
  using brute force to buckle the armor of machines and shatter the bones of
  great beasts.

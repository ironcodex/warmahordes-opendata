factions: [circle]

name: The Wild Hunt

flavor: >
  Beast masters of the Circle Orboros are right to be proud of the powerful
  warbeasts they add to their order's arsenal. When large numbers of these
  beasts are brought together, they can deal a decisive blow against the
  Circle's many enemies. The warbeasts' natural ferocity fuels them in battle to
  eradicate any opposition.


  When war requires speed, cunning, and brutality, the Wild Hunt is gathered to
  spill the enemy's blood. If the need is dire, many villages of Wolf Sworn are
  drawn together in these great hunting parties. A Wild Hunt draws upon its
  warriors' hunting skills and their knowledge of the land to launch lethal
  ambushes against enemy columns marching through the wilderness. The warriors
  of a Wild Hunt rely on their mobility to defeat technologically superior foes;
  they bleed the enemy with quick strikes, chasing down all who break ranks to
  offer them as a sacrifice to the primal power of the Devourer Wurm.

- description: One Wolf of Orboros unit in this army gains Ambush.
  clarification: >
    Ambush - You can choose not to deploy a unit with Ambush at the start of the
    game. If it is not deployed normally, you can put it into play at the end of
    any of your Control Phases after your first turn. When you do, choose any
    table edge except the back of your opponent's deployment zone. Place the
    unit with Ambush completely within 3" of the chosen table edge.

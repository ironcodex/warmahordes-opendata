flavor: >
  With a vast array of myrmidons and skilled arcanists at its disposal, House
  Shyeel is considered by some to be virtually a sixth Great Military House.
  When the time comes for House Shyeel to stoke the forges of war, it brings the
  full weight of its military forces to bear as an unstoppable tide of towering
  myrmidons supported by the immense arcane power of its formidable battle
  mages.

  clarification: >
    Shield Guard - When a friendly model is directly hit by a non-spray ranged
    attack during your opponent's turn while within 3" of a model with Shield
    Guard, you can choose to have the model with Shield Guard directly hit
    instead. It is automatically hit and suffers all damage and effects. A model
    can use Shield Guard only once per round and cannot use Shield Guard if it
    is incorporeal, knocked down, or stationary.

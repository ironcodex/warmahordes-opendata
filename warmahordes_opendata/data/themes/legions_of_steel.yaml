name: Legions of Steel

flavor: >
  The brotherhood of the Iron Fangs maintains traditions arising from ancient
  warriors who battled the beasts of the north armed only with spears and the
  indomitable courage all true Khadorans possess. Iron Fang assault forces are
  tasked with breaking enemy lines regardless of whether those lines are
  composed of towering warjacks or masses of infantry. Surrounding a hard center
  of warjacks, an Iron Fang legion marches in lockstep behind a wall of shields,
  supported by swift and brutal cavalry to protect their flanks.

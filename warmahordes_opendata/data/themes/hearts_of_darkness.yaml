factions: [infernals]

name: Hearts of Darkness

flavor: >
  It is unlikely the invading Infernals would be as strong without the aid of
  humans possessed of more selfish greed than survival instincts. As horrors
  move out from the shadows, people who have betrayed their own kind hold the
  torches to light the way for evil. Perhaps they hope to be spared by showing
  their allegiance and harvesting victims for their masters, but hope is a dying
  luxury now.

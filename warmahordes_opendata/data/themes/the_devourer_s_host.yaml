factions: [circle]

name: The Devourer's Host

flavor: >
  To sow terror and reap death, blackclads who embrace the primal aspects of
  Orboros turn to the Tharn. With murderous howls, Tharn warriors charge from
  the darkest forests to strike fear into their enemies' hearts before ripping
  them out and devouring them whole. These gruesome, gore-streaked combatants
  run side by side with all manner of beasts, intent on slaking their thirst on
  the blood of the Circle's foes. Theirs is a history of violence, and their
  motivations for war do not stray beyond devotion to the Devourer Wurm and an
  attunement with the basest of instincts.

    Each model in this army that can gain corpse tokens begins the game with one
    corpse token.

- description: One Tharn Bloodweaver unit in this army gains Ambush.
  clarification: >
    Ambush - You can choose not to deploy a unit with Ambush at the start of the
    game. If it is not deployed normally, you can put it into play at the end of
    any of your Control Phases after your first turn. When you do, choose any
    table edge except the back of your opponent's deployment zone. Place all
    models in the unit with Ambush in formation completely within 3" of the
    chosen table edge.

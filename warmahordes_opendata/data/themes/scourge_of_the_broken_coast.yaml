flavor: >
  Borne on a black tide to bring death and suffering to the mainland, the
  pirates of Cryx instill terror in the hearts of those who live on the Broken
  Coast. Comprised of swift Satyxis, merciless Black Ogrun, roaring hordes of
  blighted trollkin, and crews of Scharde sailors, raiding parties join Cryx's
  warcasters and their battlegroups in executing their bloody assaults.

  clarification: >
    Gang Fighter - When making a melee attack targeting an enemy
    model in the melee range of another friendly Faction warrior model, a model
    with Gang Fighter gains +2 to melee attack and melee damage rolls.

- description: Up to one Satyxis Blood Witch unit in this army gains Ambush.
  clarification: >
    Ambush - You can choose not to deploy a unit with Ambush at the start of the
    game. If it is not deployed normally, you can put it into play at the end of
    any of your Control Phases after your first turn. When you do, choose any
    table edge except the back of your opponent's deployment zone. Place all
    models in the unit with Ambush in formation completely within 3" of the
    chosen table edge.

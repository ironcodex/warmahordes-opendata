factions: [legion]

name: Ravens of War

flavor: >
  When speed is of the essence and the servants of the dragon must strike with
  stealth, they rely upon the Ravens of War. A force of swift-moving striders
  and grotesques, these inhuman warriors can traverse any obstacle to deliver
  sudden death no matter where the enemy may hide. Able to respond quickly to
  unexpected dangers or to pursue a fleeing enemy, these highly mobile forces
  can be relied upon to move with such speed that the battle is decided before
  their prey realizes they are under attack.

feat:
  name: Meta Principle
  flavor: >
    Syvestro's brilliant mind allows him to spot every opportunity in battle.
    By subtly guiding his soldiers and warjacks with mystical kinetic force, he
    capitalizes on the enemy's weaknesses and buys time for his injured soldiers
    to apply alchemical remedies to their injuries.
  description: >
    While in Syvestro's control range, friendly Faction models gain an
    additional die on attack and damage rolls. Discard one die of your choice in
    each roll.
    Additionally, when an enemy model is destroyed while in Syvestro's control
    range, a friendly Faction model in Syvestro's control range can remove d3
    damage points.
    Meta Principle lasts for one turn.

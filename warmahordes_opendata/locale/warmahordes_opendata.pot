# Rules - combat

msgid "Back Strike"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A back strike grants a +2 bonus to the attack roll of a melee, ranged, or"

" the attack."
msgstr ""

msgid "Concealment & Cover"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Terrain features, spells, and other effects can make it more difficult to"
" hit a model with a ranged or magic attack. A model within 1\" of an "
"intervening terrain feature can gain either a concealment bonus or a "
"cover bonus - depending on the type of terrain - to its DEF against "
"ranged and magic attacks. If you can draw a line from any part of the "
"attacker's volume to any part of the target model's volume and that line "
"passes through a terrain feature, that terrain feature is intervening. "
"Concealment and cover bonuses are not cumulative with themselves or each "
"other, but they are cumulative with other effects that modify a model's "
"DEF. In order to benefit from concealment or cover, the target model must"
" be within 1\" of that terrain feature along at least one straight line "
"between it and the attacker. See \"Terrain\" on p. 86 for details on "
"terrain features and how they provide concealment or cover.\n"
"\n"
"A model with concealment, either granted by being within 1\" of a terrain"
" feature that provides concealment in relation to its attacker or from "
"another effect, gains +2 DEF against ranged and magic attack rolls. "
"Concealment provides no benefit against spray attacks. Examples of "
"concealment- granting terrain features include low hedges and bushes.\n"
"\n"
"A model with cover, granted either by being within 1\" of a terrain "
"feature that provides cover in relation to its attacker or from another "
"effect, gains +4 DEF against ranged and magic attack rolls. Cover "
"provides no benefit against spray attacks. Examples of cover-granting "
"terrain features include stone walls, giant boulders, and buildings.\n"
"\n"
"Remember, huge-based models never gain the DEF bonuses from concealment "
"or cover."
msgstr ""

msgid "Engaged & Engaging"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a model is within an enemy model's melee range and in that model's "
"line of sight, it is engaged. When a model has an enemy model in its "
"melee range and line of sight, it is engaging that model. When a model is"
" either engaged or engaging, it is in melee, which prevents it from "
"making ranged attacks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Free Strike"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an engaged model advances out of an enemy's melee range or line of "
"sight, the enemy model can make a free strike against it just before it "
"leaves. The model makes one normal melee attack with any melee weapon "
"that has sufficient melee range to reach the moving model and gains a +2 "
"bonus to its attack roll. If the attack hits, the damage roll is "
"boosted.\n"
"\n"
"When the free strike is made treat the free striking model as being in "
"the advancing model's back arc. Free strikes do not benefit from the back"
" strike bonus.\n"
"\n"
"When a model with the Gunfighter advantage makes a free strike with a "
"ranged weapon, it only gains the +2 to hit bonus against the model "
"targeted by the attack. Likewise, if the attack hits, the damage roll "

msgstr ""

msgid "Head-Butt"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A model making a head-butt power attack smashes its head into a model to "
"drive it to the ground. A head-butt power attack made by a colossal or "
"gargantuan has a 2\" melee range. A head-butt power attack made by any "
"other model has a 0.5 melee range. The attacking model makes a melee "
"attack roll against its target. If the attack hits, the target becomes "
"knocked down and then suffers a power attack damage roll.\n"
"\n"
"A model cannot head-butt a model with a larger base."
msgstr ""

msgid "Knockdown"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some attacks and special rules cause a model to become knocked down. "
"While knocked down, a model does not have a melee range and cannot "
"advance, make special actions, make attacks, cast spells, use feats, or "
"be used to channel a spell. A knocked down model does not engage other "
"models and cannot be engaged by them. As a consequence, a model is never "
"in melee with a knocked down model. A melee attack against a knocked down"
" model automatically hits. A knocked down model has a base DEF of 5. A "
"knocked down model does not block line of sight and is never an "
"intervening model.\n"
"\n"
"A knocked down model can stand up at the start of its next activation "
"unless it became knocked down during its controller's turn. In that case "
"it cannot stand up until its controller's next turn, even if it has not "
"yet activated this turn. A model cannot stand up during a turn it was "
"knocked down. Knockdown is not cumulative; a model cannot become knocked "
"down while it is knocked down.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE: A model becomes knocked down during your opponent's turn, and "
"before it gets a chance to stand up it is affected by an attack that "
"would normally cause it to be knocked down. It is not affected by the "
"second instance of knockdown, so it can still stand up on your turn.\n"
"\n"
"To stand up, a knocked down model forfeits either its Normal Movement or "
"its Combat Action. A model that forfeits its Combat Action to stand can "
"use its Normal Movement to make a full advance but cannot run, charge, or"
" perform a slam or trample power attack that activation. When a model "
"stands, it ceases to be knocked down."

"model moves through models with smaller bases without contacting them. "
"Unlike when a model is slammed, rough terrain does not affect this "
